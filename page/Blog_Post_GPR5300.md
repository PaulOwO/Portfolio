# My first OpenGL scene

## Preview

![](https://github.com/PaulOwO/Portfolio/blob/11292ba72cb82405a4485d35dd92b5c5abd537b9/gif/opengl.gif) The blur is done willingly !

We are going to see overall how the scene evolve throuout 2 months and thanks to wich techniques.
We are also going to stop to realy see how I did my normal mapping.

## The setup

- First of all this project was done for the module GPR3500 at the SAE institute of Geneva.
- The project was done on [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org) which allow us to do graphics programming on a lot of platforms.
- We used [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org) to create our application window and take input.
- In addition to our course, we used the site [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com) to help us throught programming.

Each week we saw different graphic programming thecnique and had to implement thus we needed/wanted in our final scene,
so let's get started!
